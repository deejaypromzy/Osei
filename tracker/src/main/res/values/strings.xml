Protein is kind of like the backup generator when the primary energy source goes out. It\'s great that the body has this backup system in place, yet when proteins are used up for energy, they are no longer available to do their life-sustaining jobs, like helping with muscle contractions and maintaining muscle and other body tissues            ]]>

        <p>If you&apos;ve recently decided to bottlefeed your newborn</a>, you&apos;re probably full of questions about formula preparation, sanitizing utensils, feeding positions, and burping techniques. Here are seven steps for successfully  your baby.</p><p><b>1. Make sure all bottles, nipples, and other utensils are clean. </b>If the water in your home is chlorinated, clean the utensils in your dishwasher or wash them in hot tap water with dishwashing detergent and then rinse them in hot tap water. If you have well water or nonchlorinated water, either place the utensils in boiling water for five to 10 minutes or use a process called terminal heating.</p><p>In terminal heating you clean, but do not sterilize, the bottles in advance. You then fill them with the prepared formula and cap them loosely. Next, the filled bottles are placed in a pan with water reaching about halfway up the bottles, and the water is brought to a gentle boil for about 25 minutes.<<p><b>2. Read the directions.</b> Be sure to follow the manufacturer&apos;s directions exactly for the formula type you choose. Too much water and your baby won&apos;t get the calories and nutrients she needs; too little water and the high concentration of formula could cause diarrhea or dehydration.</p><p><b>3. Prepare the formula.</b> Bring the water you plan to use in the formula to a boil for approximately one minute. Then add it to the formula powder. If you&apos;re preparing this in advance, be sure to store it in the refrigerator. If the formula is left out of the refrigerator for longer than one hour or if you don&apos;t use refrigerated formula within 24 hours, throw it out.</p><p><b>4. Warm the refrigerated formula.</b> Refrigerated formula doesn&apos;t necessarily have to be warmed up for your baby, but most infants prefer it at least at room temperature. The easiest way to warm refrigerated or frozen milk is to place the container in a pan of water on the stove at low heat and rotate it frequently. Microwave ovens should not be used for heating bottles; this can overheat the milk in the center of the container. Even if the bottle feels comfortably warm to your touch, the superheated milk in the center can scald your baby&apos;s mouth. Also, the bottle itself can explode if left in the microwave too long.</p><p>If you warm a bottle or use it immediately after terminal heating, test it in advance to make sure it&apos;s not too hot for your baby. The easiest way to test the temperature is to shake a few drops on the inside of your wrist.</p><p><b>5. Place your baby in a feeding position.</b> Cradle her in a semi-upright position and support her head. Don&apos;t feed her lying down -- formula can flow into the middle ear, causing an infection. To prevent your baby from swallowing air as she sucks, tilt the bottle so that the formula fills the neck of the bottle and covers the nipple.</p><p><b>6. Take note of your baby&apos;s intake.</b> The pediatrician will probably ask you how much your baby has eaten, so be prepared to answer the question. Your newborn will probably take between two and four ounces per feeding during his first few weeks (during the first few days, he may take less than an ounce at feedings), and will probably be hungry every two to four hours. It&apos;s best to feed your baby on demand. Don&apos;t encourage your baby to finish the bottle if he&apos;s not interested. And if he&apos;s still sucking enthusiastically when the bottle is empty, offer him more.</p><p><b>7. Burp your baby.</b> Babies get fussy and cranky when they swallow air during feedings. This happens more often with bottlefed infants, though breastfed infants can also swallow air. To prevent a tummy full of air, burp your baby frequently -- after every two or three ounces of formula. If your baby doesn&apos;t burp after a couple of minutes of trying, resume feeding. Here are the three best positions:</p><ul></ul><ul><li><b>Over the shoulder:</b> Drape your baby over your shoulder and firmly pat or rub her back.</li><li><b>On the lap:</b> Sit your baby upright, lean her weight forward against the heel of your hand, and firmly pat or rub her back.</li><li><b>Lying down:</b> Place baby stomach-down on your lap and firmly rub or pat her back.</li></ul><ul></ul>

        <item><![CDATA[ The Power of Protein
It\'s easy to understand the excitement. Protein is an important component of every cell in the body. Hair and nails are mostly made of protein. Your body uses protein to build and repair tissues. You also use protein to make enzymes, hormones, and other body chemicals. Protein is an important building block of bones, muscles, cartilage, skin, and blood.

Along with fat and carbohydrates, protein is a "macronutrient," meaning that the body needs relatively large amounts of it. Vitamins and minerals, which are needed in only small quantities, are called "micronutrients." But unlike fat and carbohydrates, the body does not store protein, and therefore has no reservoir to draw on when it needs a new supply. ]]></item>

Fats are the main source of energy for satisfactory growth and physical activity during early infancy. This energy requirement is not easily met where diets are low in fat (less than 15 percent of total calories), which partly explains the high prevalence of malnutrition in such areas.

Fats should also be considered in terms of their structural function during the first two years of life. They provide the fatty acids and cholesterol needed to form cell membranes in all the organs. Moreover, important organs such as the retina and the central nervous system are mainly composed of fats.

Most of the fats needed to form these tissues are essential fatty acids (EFAs) which cannot be synthesized by the organism and have to be acquired through nutrition. Mother\'s milk has a special fat composition that makes it unique for good child nutrition. It contains factors that facilitate the digestion of fats, while its chemical composition makes it more digestible and includes a balanced supply of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids.

Recent documented research on n-3 a -linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has focused on effects on growth and brain development. In 1993, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Fats and Oils in Human Nutrition stressed that infants should be breast-fed if possible and that breast-milk substitutes (infant formula) should mimic breast milk in faty acid content.

There is a relationship between consumption of fats and income level in developing countries. Fat consumption is insufficient in low-income groups, and this lower consumption of fats and oils has an adverse effect on the nutritional energy status of children and adults in these groups.

           Vitamins allow your body to grow and develop. They also play important roles in bodily functions such as metabolism, immunity and digestion. There are 13 essential vitamins, including vitamins A, C, D, E, and K and B vitamins such as riboflavin and folate. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, the best way to meet your vitamin needs is to eat a balanced diet containing a variety of foods. If you can\'t meet your needs through food alone, you may require dietary supplements. Seek guidance from your doctor or dietitian before taking supplements            ]]>
